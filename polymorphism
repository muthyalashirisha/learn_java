polymorphism: multiple behaviours (of reference variable)
two type: 
1. compile time (static binding):
    decides which to call during compile time
    ex: method overloading
2. run time (dynamic binding) 
    decides which to call during run time
    ex 1. method overriding
       2. Dynamic method dispatch
